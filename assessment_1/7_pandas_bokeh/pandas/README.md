# 7.1 - Pandas

This practical, comprising of a collection of exercises from Software Carpentry,
introduces the Pandas module.
The key concepts introduced here are:

1. [Reading Tabular Data into DataFrames](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/07-reading-tabular/index.html): This first introduces the Pandas libray, makes use of it to read in a CSV file and then shows us how we can obtain basic information about our dataset.
2. [Pandas DataFrames](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/08-data-frames/index.html): This exercise explains how to access data from a DataFrame by row or by column, and how we can subset data different logical criteria.
3. [Plotting](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/09-plotting/index.html): This exercise demonstrates how to produce basic plots of a time series dataset.

These exercises make use of Jupyter Notebooks - one of the standard methods of
exploring data in Python.
