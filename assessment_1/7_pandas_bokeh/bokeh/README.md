# 7.2 - Bokeh

This practical focuses on the basics of the Bokeh module using some exercises
from the [Bokeh
website](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/quickstart.html
"Bokeh Quickstart").
This introduces a range of plotting elements that can be included in Bokeh
graphics.
Whilst the exercises can be undertaken using a script, much of it has be
completed using a Jupyter Notebook in this case.
