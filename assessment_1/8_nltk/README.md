# 8 - NLTK

This practical focuses on natural language processing using [The Waste
Land](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1321/1321-0.txt "The Waste Land, T.S.
Elliot") by T.S. Elliot as a corpus.
The key tasks for this practical are:

* Read in the poem.
* Parse the poem, identifying proper nouns.
* Use the Google Maps API to search for the proper nouns and see if they are
  geocodable places.

It is important to note that in order to use the Google Maps API, an API key is
required; if you wish to run this code, you should get your own key.
