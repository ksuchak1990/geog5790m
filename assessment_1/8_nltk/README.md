# 8 - NLTK

This practical focuses on natural language processing using [The Waste
Land](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1321/1321-0.txt "The Waste Land, T.S.
Elliot") by T.S. Elliot as an corpus.
The keys tasks for this practical are:

* Read in the poem.
* Parse the poem, identifying proper nouns.
* Use the Google Maps API to search for the proper nouns and see if they are
  geocodable places.
