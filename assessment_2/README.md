# Assessment 2

A subdirectory containing the work undertaken for the second assessment of this
module.
In this assessment, I have produced a version of the Ensemble Kalman Filter
(EnKF).
The filter is codified as a class which wraps around a model, allowing it to run
the model and update it with data as they become available.
This is documented in a report.
