# GEOG5790M - Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Advanced Skills

This repository contains work undertaken for the GEOG5790M module at the
University of Leeds; this follows on from the GEOG5990M module.

The aim of the module is to further develop Python programming skills by working
on the following investigative processes:

* Data processing
* Analysis and visualisation
* Modelling

The module consists of two parts: 1) a set of practicals that come together to
form the online portfolio for assessment 1; 2) an independent project that forms
assessment 2.
